Create a vite app for react js 
    earlier we were using npx create-react-app <app-name>, but now it is being deprecated so we will be using the vite to create the react project.
    - command -----  npm create vite@latest ./  -- --template react
    npm install
    npm run dev
Configure the tailwing css
    npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    paste the content from tailwind css website to  the tailwind config file
    and then for index.css file in the src folder

    remove the app.css file as it not required for us the entire journey of development

After all this head to the app.jsx file and delete  all the default code and use rafce for the boilerplate

And then modify the root styling in the index.css file and copy the import from the google fonts website and paste in the index.css

copy the assets from the zip file
and them install react icons npm i react-icon



Now lets us design the components for the porfolio.
In the app.jsx folder set the background and use the code from bg.ibelick.com website
create a components folder in the src folder
